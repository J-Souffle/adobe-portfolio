                    As the world of Liberty finds itself embroiled in a time of great political upheaval and unrest, a group of young individuals find themselves at the heart of a war between the United States and North Korea. Our protagonists, a band of orphaned children, find themselves forced to flee from their homes and into the dangerous wilderness in order to avoid being conscripted into the conflict. As they embark on their journey, they must navigate the perils of a world ravaged by war and struggle to find the necessary supplies to ensure their survival. Along the way, they face many challenges and dangers, ultimately coming to understand the importance of standing up for their country and its values, rather than running away from their duty. <br/>

                <iframe style="min-width: 100%; min-height: 25vh;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mgFzXNRuZiA"></iframe>
                <p>I was highly obsessed with visual effects and computer generated simulations during my high school years. In particular, I was drawn to the impact of smoke simulations in cinema, and I was determined to master the technique. After many hours of practice, I am now pleased with the results of my work, which took 30 hours to render using Blender 3D. The volumetric smoke simulation showcases my skills and dedication to the field.</p>

                <iframe style="min-width: 100%; min-height: 25vh;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/avOyviaBn2k"></iframe>
                <p>I was captivated by the complexity and detail of fracture simulations. As a budding CGI artist, I was determined to learn the techniques used to create large-scale simulations, such as a collapsing bridge or an exploding structure. This simulation required the manipulation of 5000 individual fragments and took me 8 hours to render inside of Cinema 4D.</p>

                <p>I desired to create a seamless, looping render featuring a variety of simulations, in addition to incorporating spatial stereo audio. For example, when I placed the fire near the camera, the audio primarily played through the right speaker. After the rendering process was complete, I was satisfied with the outcome. The rendering process took a total of 18 hours.</p>
